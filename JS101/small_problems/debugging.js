The chosen method .forEach returns undefined. This code is not capturing
the boolean return value of 'true' on line 4 when the if statement runs.
In order to make this work, we would have to save that value. Right now,
the for loop runs, the if statement runs, the value true is returned, and then
the code continues to line 8 and returns false. False is always output from
this function regardless of if the for loop ran.

.join() is an array method. dishName is the result of concatenating strings that
are a result of a function that takes an array input. Since dishName is not an
array, .join() can't work on it. However, .concat() would be a method that could
do the same thing as .join, but with strings.
